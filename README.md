# Music Album Review System

## 📝 Project Overview & Objectives
This project is a **Full-Stack CRUD Application** designed to provide a streamlined platform for music enthusiasts to document and manage their personal album reviews. The primary goal is to implement a functional system with distinct User and Admin roles, ensuring data integrity, secure access, and automated deployment.

---

## 🔐 Test Accounts
To quickly test the application, you can use the following pre-configured accounts:

**Admin Account:**
* **Email:** `felix@gmail.com`
* **Password:** `123`

**User Accounts:**
* **Email:** `felix123@gmail.com` | **Password:** `123` (this account has 9 reviews)
* **Email:** `felix2405@gmail.com` | **Password:** `123` (this account has no review)

---

## 🚀 MVP Features
* **User Authentication:** Secure Login and Registration.
* **Album Review CRUD:** Users can Create, Read, Update, and Delete their own reviews.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Oversight capabilities for administrators to manage all system content.
* **Protected Access:** Route guards to prevent unauthorized access.

## 📂 System Structure

### **1. Backend (Node.js & Express)**
* `config/db.js`: MongoDB connection setup.
* `controllers/`: Logic for `auth`, `album`, `review`, and `admin` operations.
* `models/`: Data schemas for `User.js`, `Album.js`, and `Review.js`.
* `routes/`: API Endpoints (e.g., `reviewRoutes.js`, `adminRoutes.js`).
* `middleware/`: 
    * `authMiddleware.js`: Validates JWT tokens.
    * `adminMiddleware.js`: Restricts access to Admin-only resources.
* `test/test.js`: Scripts for automated testing in CI/CD.

### **2. Frontend (React.js)**
* `src/context/AuthContext.js`: Manages global user state and authentication tokens.
* `src/components/`:
    * `ReviewForm.jsx` & `ReviewList.jsx`: Core CRUD UI components.
    * **Route Guards:** `ProtectedRoute.jsx`, `AdminRoute.jsx`, and `RedirectIfLoggedIn.jsx` to prevent unauthorized access
* `src/pages/`: Main views including `Login.jsx`, `Register.jsx`, `Reviews.jsx`, and `AdminPanel.jsx`.
* `src/App.js`: Defines application routes and applies security wrappers.

## 🔄 Core Application Flows

### **1. Authentication & Security Guard**
* **Guest Access:** Guests can choose to register a new account or log in to the system.
* **Unauthorized Access:** If a guest attempts to access a User-specific URL, they are automatically redirected to the **Login** screen.
* **Logged-in Redirection:** If an authenticated user attempts to access the **Login** or **Register** pages, they are redirected back to their main view.
* **Boundary Control:** If a guest or a regular user attempts to access the **Admin Panel**, access is denied, and they are redirected away from the page.

### **2. User Review Logic**
* **Uniqueness:** A User is restricted to writing **only one review per album**.
* **Authorization:** Users can only edit or delete their own reviews. The system prevents editing or deleting reviews belonging to other users.
* **Data Integrity:** Users are not allowed to edit reviews that they have already deleted themselves, nor can they edit reviews that have been removed by an Admin. **This same restriction applies to the delete action**: users cannot delete a review that has already been removed.

### **3. Admin Authority**
* **Full CRUD:** Admins have the same capabilities as users regarding their own content.
* **Review Moderation:** Admins have exclusive access to the **Admin Panel**, allowing them to view all user reviews and delete any invalid or inappropriate content.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js, Axios, Context API.
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
* **Database:** MongoDB (Mongoose).
* **DevOps:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`).

## ⚙️ Installation & Environment Setup

### 1. Database Configuration (MongoDB Atlas)
Before running the application, you must configure a MongoDB database:
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) and create a **New Cluster**.
2. Navigate to **Database Access** and add a new database user (save the username and password).
3. Navigate to **Network Access** and add a new IP address whitelist: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow access from anywhere).
4. Go back to your Cluster, click **Connect** -> **Drivers**, and copy the connection string.

> **💡 Note for Assessors:** You can still use the current `.env` file provided with the project. However, if you wish to log into MongoDB Atlas to view and modify the raw database directly, please use the following credentials:
> * **Email:** `felixsuperbb@gmail.com`
> * **Password:** `Pqyolo@2405`

### 2. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository using this link: `https://github.com/Phuc2405/Music-Album-Review-System.git`. Once the download is complete, navigate into the newly created project folder.

### 3. Backend Setup
First, type `cd backend` to navigate into the backend folder, then type `npm install` to install all necessary backend dependencies.
After the installation finishes, revise the file named `.env` directly inside the `backend` folder. Open this file and add your MongoDB connection string and a secret key. It should look something like this: `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0...` and `JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key`.
Finally, check the backend server by typing `npm start`.

### 4. Frontend Setup
Open a new terminal window, type `cd ../frontend` (or `cd frontend` if you are at the root) to navigate into the frontend folder, and type `npm install` to install all required frontend dependencies.
Once everything is installed, check the frontend server by typing `npm start`.

### 5. Run the System
To run the full application properly, go back to the root folder of the project in your terminal. Start the whole system to test it by typing `npm start`.
